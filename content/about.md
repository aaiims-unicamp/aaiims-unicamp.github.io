EAGLE is a framework for developing multiagent systems based upon cognitive mechanisms. It was inspired by the conceptual framework presented in Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA). EAGLE is currently being developed in Python 3 with LangGraph. The project is maintained by the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP).
